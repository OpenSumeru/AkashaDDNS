# AkashaDDNS-rust

A simple DDNS updater using cloudflare API, but RIIR!

> I never said that `This version will not update anymore! please use cpp version instead`

> This version is ***untested***. Make sure that you really want to use it. Using the CPP version is sometimes a better choice.

## Build&Run
Just as usual, we can use `cargo` to build and run easily.

``` bash
cargo build --release
```

``` bash
cargo run --release
```
